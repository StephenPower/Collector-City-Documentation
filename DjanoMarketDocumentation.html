<h1> Django Market Documentation </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h2>Django Market Has Three Goals:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Support Online Activities For Small to Medium Businesses:<b>Marketing, Selling, Inventory Management & Customer Management</b> </li>
	<li><b>Aggregate "normal"</b> business activities (inventory, customers,auctions, selling) to trigger marketing, selling, searching activites. Same for blogging.</li>
	<li><b>SAAS</b> Allow a single platform to host multiple marketplaces and multiple stores on each marketplace</li>
    </ol>


<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<ol>
<li>I'm not looking to build <b>every conceivable feature.</b></li>
<li>Focus on the features small business need and <b>make sure they are intuitive and easy to use.</b></li> 
<li>Let's figure out <b>what needs to be cut,</b> that's just as important</li>
</ol>


<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Small Business Owners</b> Paying high listing fees at the usual places</li>
	<li>Designers, allowing them to <b>build beautiful websites easily</b></li>
</ol>


<h2>Documentation Sets</h2>
<P>There are Three Sets of Documentation</P>
<ol>
<li><b>Small Business Owners</b> on how to use their shops</li>
<li>Designers On <b>How to Build shops</b></li>
<li><b>Developers</b> on how to install, run and extend Django Market</li>
</ol>



<p>Extensive documentation is a sign of a poorly implemented software. <b>No documentation is just lazy</b></p>
